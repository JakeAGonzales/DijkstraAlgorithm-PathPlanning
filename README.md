# DijkstraAlgorithm-PathPlanning
This repository uses PyGame to create a user-interface for grid world simulations of single-robot and multi-robot path planning. The grid world is mapped directly to an undirected graph G = (V, E) constructed using NetworkX and the shortest paths are computed by using Dijkstra's algorithm.
